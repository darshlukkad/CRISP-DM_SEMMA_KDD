# CRISP-DM_SEMMA_KDD

# How to run (for absolute beginners)

1. Open **Google Colab** (https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click **File ‚Üí Upload notebook** and upload ONE of these files:
   - `CRISP_DM_Telco_Churn.ipynb`
   - `SEMMA_Credit_Default.ipynb`
   - `KDD_Students_Performance.ipynb`
3. Run cells from **top to bottom** (press the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button on the left of each cell).
4. When a cell asks you to **upload `kaggle.json`**, do it (see the first markdown cell in each notebook for how to get it).
5. Watch for any messages that say **"upload CSV"** ‚Äî only do that if the Kaggle API is blocked for your account.
6. At the end, you‚Äôll see evaluation results and a saved model (for CRISP/SEMMA).

üìå Tips:
- If a plot looks squished, re-run the plotting cell.
- If you accidentally skip a cell, just run it and keep going.
